# Electricity Price Prediction
This project predicts electricity prices using machine learning models, including Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest. The application features a user-friendly interface built with Flask and a backend for accurate predictions.

# Features
Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest
Web Interface: Developed with Flask to input data and display predictions
Interactive Form: Users can input features via an HTML form with 13 fields
# Deployment: Hosted on Render
# Demo
